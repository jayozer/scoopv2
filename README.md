## Background
The Food Safety Program enforces health code regulations, which may result in administrative actions, a suspension, and/or a revocation of a permit to operate when violations are identified in a food facility. To enforce health code regulations, Environmental Health food safety inspectors, inspect over 5,000 locations in San Francisco, including restaurants, bars, markets, bakeries, pushcarts, stadium food facilities, and any other facility that serves food to the public. (San Francisco Department of Public Health). The coronavirus outbreak brought health and cleanliness as the top priorities in everyday lives. As the restaurants start to open up, they are tasked to update their approach to cleanliness. A list of new guidelines was published by the department of health mandating businesses to take additional measures and protect their customers. The initiative creates a logistics issue for the health department to put in a plan to monitor and enforce these guidelines. The study aims to analyze inspections over time and infer a score after COVID and assist the San Francisco Department of Public Health to prioritize resources for post-COVID-19 inspections.

All data cleaning was performed in Python. ML Algorithms (kNN & Random Forest) were ran in R.
